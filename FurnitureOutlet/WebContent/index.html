            <br> 
            <strong>Open 7 days a week,</strong> family owned Black
            River Furniture Outlet has been offering furniture in some way for
            the last 20 years. We started out with a small section of furniture
            in our Black River Surplus store and have grown to our new location
            of over 20,000 square feet of upholstery, mattresses, dining,
            entertainment, bedroom, cabin, occasional and home office furniture.
            And we have great deals on rugs too! <br>
            <div style="height: 8px;"></div>
            
            <strong>When it comes to upholstery,</strong> we try to have
            50 – 100 recliners on hand at all times. We have racks of sofas and
            sectionals set up for our customers. Our sleep center offers 25
            different styles of mattresses. In our dining section we stock drop
            leaf tables to major dining sets both regular and counter height. We
            always have bedroom sets and individual bedroom pieces available. We
            usually have a reasonable variety of closeouts and stock items when
            it comes to entertainment, home office and coffee table sets. The
            majority of rugs we stock are from Dalton Georgia and they are always
            priced right. <br>
            <div style="height: 8px;"></div>
            
            <strong>Our cabin furniture</strong> area offers aspen,
            hickory, pine and northern cedar products along with a custom
            ordering upholstery program. It's working out great for our customers
            because they can get what they want at reasonable prices. Nice cabin
            furniture is expensive, but it doesn't have to be as expensive as
            what our customers have told us about and what we've seen. Currently
            we are committing to a modest interstate sign that will read “Cabin
            Furniture Outlet” on I94. If you've seen this sign and you need cabin
            furniture please stop by. <br>
            <div style="height: 8px;"></div>
            
            <strong>We are not a high pressure</strong> furniture store.
            We are a customer oriented store that recognizes that you might want
            to purchase today or 6 months from today or whenever. Our goal is to
            give you information, product selection, good pricing and to build a
            business relationship. Our products change weekly as we are a volume
            business continuing to build variety and opportunity for our
            customers. <br>
            <div style="height: 8px;"></div>
            
            <strong>Welcome &amp; be invited </strong>if you live in Black
            River Falls or the surrounding area, or if you are passing through,
            to shop Black River Furniture Outlet! Open 7 days a week. Hwy 54 “On
            The East Side!”
